# Introduction

Hello and welcome to my humble blog! <br />
My name is Hoon Wee, and I am a freelance software engineer from South Korea.

# Purpose of building my personal blog

I am a very curious person so I spend a lot of time searching and reading new stuffs. Unfortunately I realized that
most of the things in my head just vanishes very soon, so I'd decided to write down to revisit what I've learned before. <br />

So mainly this blog should work as my external brain-harddrive, plus the act of 'writing' something itself will help my brain
to memorize things better.<br />

For visitors, I hope others who seek for the common knowledge could get some useful information from my blog.

# Expected readers?

Mostly I'll write about software development, UI/UX design for informative posts.
However also I'd love to write about my daily life, and some meaningless philosophy like a personal diary.

# Updates

## How often will I post

My goal is to post an article per week. I hope that I am not too lazy :).

## Feature enhancements

This blog is not in it's final form; actually it will never be. I'll make small changes everytime when there
are some cool functionalities to add in my website, although it shouldn't be done too often. <br />
Developers who are curious about how I built this website should find out at [this link](https://github.com/MRGRAVITY817/hoon-blog).
