# Introduction

Hello and welcome to my humble blog! My name is Hoon Wee, and as of
this year I am a freelance software engineer. I've started my career as a freelancer
quite recently, but I am enjoying it.{' '}

## What do I build?

I mainly build a web based service for my clients. Building web&mobile application is my major skills.

# What interests me

## Blockchain

Recently I have found myself fallen into blockchain technology, which is a humongous wave in various industry.
Literally every people around me talks about blockchain related stuffs like NFTs, Smart contracts, DeFi, Web 3.0.
So actually it was hard not to get interested with it, so I spent several months to study to understand the mechanisms
and the adaptations of it.
