# Introduction

Hello and welcome to my humble blog! <br />
My name is Hoon Wee, and I am a freelance software engineer from South Korea.

# Purpose of building my personal blog

I am a very curious person so I spend a lot of searching and reading. Unfortunately I realized that
many of the knowledge just vaporize very soon after I learn once, so I'd came out of an idea of
writing down what I've learned in displayable format. <br />
So mainly this blog should work as my external brain-harddrive, but also it would be great if
someone who seeks for the common knowledge.

# Expected readers?

Mostly I'll write about software development, UI/UX design for informative posts.
However also I'd love to write about my daily life, and some meaningless philosophy like a personal diary.

# Updates

This blog is not in it's final form; actually it will never be. I'll make small changes everytime when there
are some cool functionalities to add in my website, although it shouldn't be done too often. <br />
Developers who are curious about how I built this website should find out at [this link](https://github.com/MRGRAVITY817/hoon-blog).
