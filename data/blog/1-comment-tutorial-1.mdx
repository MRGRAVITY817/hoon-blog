## Let's build our own comments section because... why not?

Hi yall folks! In this series, we will use sexy combination - Next.js + Supabase - to build a comment section, just like my blog's comment sections has down below.

### Our goal

Just like every good-old Todo list tutorials, we will build simple **CRUD**(**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate and **D**elete) features for our comments.

- Adding comments
- Reading comments
- Editing comments
- Deleting comments
- Replying to comments

The follow-along code can be found [here.](https://github.com/MRGRAVITY817/supabse-comments/tree/part-1)

### What do we need?

Obviously, we'll be using those three:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): Probably the best production-ready frontend framework in this planet
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/): Trendy BaaS(Backend as a Service) product for PostgreSQL lovers

And also some extras that will make our project super-easy:

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS library that will make styling super-easy.
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/): Super-simple data fetching/caching library

## Local Settting: Next.js and TailwindCSS

### Create Next App

We'll first create a basic Typescript-based Next.js application using `npx create-next-app`.

```bash:Terminal
$ npx create-next-app --typescript supabase-comments
```

When the project is created, head to the files directory and you'll see those basic files.
We won't be needing all of them, so we'll remove some of them.

```bash:Project
...node_modules
├── package.json
├── pages
│   ├── _app.tsx
│   ├── api
│   │   └── hello.ts
│   └── index.tsx
├── public              ## <- Remove
│   ├── favicon.ico     ## <- Remove
│   └── vercel.svg      ## <- Remove
├── styles
│   ├── Home.module.css ## <- Remove
│   └── globals.css
├── tsconfig.json
└── yarn.lock
```

### Add TailwindCSS for NextJS

Above done, then we'll add TailwindCSS & other dependencies for our styling.

```bash:Terminal
$ yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
$ yarn tailwindcss init -p
```

The last command will create `tailwindcss.config.js` file, which is a config javascript file for TailwindCSS.
This simple file does a lot, but right now we'll just define which files should TailwindCSS watch for.

```javascript:tailwindcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

And then, replace contents in `styles/globals.css` with the code down below.

```css:styles/globals.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Now we can properly use our TailwindCSS with NextJS!
To test if it works, replace the contents in `pages/index.tsx` with the code down below.

```tsx:pages/index.tsx
import type { NextPage } from "next";
import Head from "next/head";

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>Comments Page</title>
      </Head>
      <div className="p-12">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Comments!</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

Run the following command to serve web page in development environment,

```bash:Terminal
$ yarn dev
```

... and head to http://localhost:3000 to see the bold typed **Comments!** in the blank web page.

Well done! We are done with our local settings(except SWR, but we'll install it later), so let's head to remote setting.

## Remote Setting: Supabase

### Create an organization and a project

Head to [official Supabase website](https://supabase.com/) and sign in with your Github account.

Then it will lead you to the app dashboard.
Click `New Project` and then click `+ New Organization` to create your new project team.
(If you already have an organization, feel free to skip creating one)

Then it will tell you to create a new name for your organization. Just type any cool name, and hit `Create organization`.

<Image
  alt={`Create new organization`}
  src={'/static/images/blog/comment-tutorial/create-org.png'}
  comment={`Pick a nice looking name :)`}
  height={400}
/>

Now for the organization we've just created, we'll create a new project which will contain SQL tables.

1. Name: I'll just name it "Master Supabase", but the naming doesn't matter.
2. Database Password: For the password, try using passgen tool to create a strong one. I normally create one from [PassGen.co](https://passgen.co/), with length longer than 14.
3. Region: Choose the nearest place where you live(as for me, Seoul).
4. Pricing Plan: Choose 'Free tier', but you can upgrade later if you want.

Once finished the form, hit `Create new project`.

<Image
  alt={`Create new project`}
  src={'/static/images/blog/comment-tutorial/create-project.png'}
  comment={`Project in Supabase is just a PostgreSQL database, packed with cool backend features.`}
  height={1000}
/>

And now we have our brand new Supabase project! Feel free to explore around, discover what you can do.

### Create `comments` table

Now we will make a SQL table called `comments`. To do that click a 'Table editor' menu in left panel of the dashboard.
If your project is new, the there will be no tables in it. Let's hit `Create a new table`.

Then it will show you a side panel to insert form for your table's settings.

1. Name: `comments`, but feel free to choose other name.
2. Description: This is optional, and I am gonna skip it this time.
3. Enable Row Level Security: This is a fancy feature in Supabase, but we'll discover it my later post. Now we just skip it.
4. Columns: We'll edit & add several columns like the image below.<br />Make sure you **change the type of 'id'** column into uuid!

<Image
  alt={`Create new table`}
  src={'/static/images/blog/comment-tutorial/create-table.png'}
  comment={``}
  height={700}
/>

If you've finished and confirmed the form, hit `Save` button.

Now we have our comments table! Let me explain each table columns' role :

- `id`: An unique identifier of the column.
- `created_at`: We'll use this to sort our comments in created order.
- `updated_at`: We'll use this and `created_at`'s difference to tell if the comment has been edited.
- `username`: This will be used to indicate user who wrote the comment.
- `payload`: Actual content of the comment.
- `reply_of`: I will save the comment's id that we are replying to.

## Summary

In this post we've set the development environment,

- A NextJS application, with Typescript and TailwindCSS settings
- A Supabase comment table to create/edit/read/delete our comments

In the next post, we'll dive in to the actual CRUD features with our comments.
We'll use awesome `@supabase/supabase-js` node library to interact with our comments table.

Until then, Happy coding!
