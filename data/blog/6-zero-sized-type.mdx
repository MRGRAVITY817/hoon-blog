## A struct type without any fields

### Rust's modern type system

Rust is a modern language that has adopted lot's of good features from senior languages.
For example, **Traits** in Rust has a concept that resembles both Haskell's _Type Classes_ and Java/Typescript's _Interfaces_.
And special types like `Option<T>` and `Result<T,E>` are inspired from lot's of functional programming languages.
Thanks to those adopted concepts, Rust's type system gives outstanding developer experience.

### Zero-sized type

Today I want to introduce one of the most underrated type pattern called "zero-sized type(shortened as ZST)".
We can declare them like this.

```rust
struct ZeroSizedType;
```

ZST doesn't contain any fields, which means there's no need to allocate any memory space for this type - makes sense for the name 'zero-sized'!
Question is, what's the use of some struct type if it isn't constructed with fields? Let's find out.

## Usage of Zero-sized type - a state machine

The most straighforward example to understand the usage of zero-sized type is a state-machine.
But what is a "state machine"? According to _Wikipedia_,

> A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural:
> automata), finite automaton, or simply a **state machine**, is a mathematical
> model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of
> a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state
> to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is
> called a transition.

Looks pretty academic, but state machines can be easily found in real life.
An example image below, we have a simple process of delivering food for our customer.
Since it has states(reserved, cooking, delivering and arrived) and transitions between them, it's a state machine.

There are 4 states - `Reserved, Cooking, Delivering` and `Arrived`.
And there are 8 possible transitions from one state to another intercepted state. By connecting transitions, we can create various scenarios(or paths).

Let me show you one of the paths - the most optimistic food delivery scenario.

1. `Reserved`: Our customer ask for a food delivery, then we tell the customer that the delivery reservation is confirmed if there's enough food.
2. `Reserved` &rarr; `Cooking` : Once the delivery is reserved, the chef should start cooking the food.
3. `Cooking` &rarr; `Delivering` : Once food is ready, chef sends the food to our delivery man/woman.
4. `Delivering` &rarr; `Arrived` : Food has arrived to our customer. Hooray!

So far we've seen the state transitions with the green path, which is a _happy path_. But in real life, this might go red, which is _sad path_ ...

5. `Arrived` &rarr; `Delivering` : Oh no! We delivered different food to our customer. We should go back to the kitchen with this food.
6. `Delivering` &rarr; `Cooking` : We tell our chef that we gave a wrong food to our customer, so we should cook a correct one.
7. `Cooking` &rarr; `Reserved` : Our chef choose not to cook, because the kitchen is out of ingredients. We should inform our customer about this.
   (Alternatively, we can just cook it and do `Cooking` &rarr; `Delivery` &rarr; `Arrived` again.)
8. `Cooking` &rarr; `Reserved` : We tell our excuse to the customer, and cancel the reservation and refund the money.

What a dramatic turn of event! There are tons of possible combinations we can accomplish. You name one!

## Building food delivery state machine with ZST

We can build an exact same food delivery state machine with Rust's ZST.
The full code can be seen [here](https://gist.github.com/MRGRAVITY817/3fe92b209ac32d93e6fc0ebaf647288b).

To start a new Rust project to follow along my code, run `cargo new <project-name>`.
Once the project has been set, head to `main.rs` file and let's begin!

### 1. States and Default

```rust:main.rs
use std::marker::PhantomData;

struct Reserved;
struct Cooking;
struct Delivering;
struct Arrived;

struct FoodDelivery<State = Reserved> {
    state: PhantomData<State>,
}

impl Default for FoodDelivery<Reserved> {
    fn default() -> Self {
        let state = PhantomData;
        Self { state }
    }
}
```

This is how our code starts.

- We created 4 zero-side structs, which will act as `State`s for our `FoodDelivery`.
- `FoodDelivery` is a state machine. It receives generic parameter `State` which obviously holds current state.
- By assigning `<State = Reserved>`, we designate our default state as `Reserved`.
  - Since there's a _default_ generic type, we should implement `Default` for `Reserved` state.
- The `state`'s type should be `PhantomData` since our states are _zero-sized_.

Now we have our starting state `Reserved`, let's add green/red paths for 4 states.

### 2. Green/Red paths - State transitions

```rust:main.rs
...

impl FoodDelivery<Reserved> {
    fn reserved(&self) -> FoodDelivery<Cooking> {
        println!("Your delivery has been successfully placed!");
        println!("Now we'll start cooking your food.\n");
        self.proceed::<Cooking>()
    }

    fn cancel_order(&self) -> Self {
        println!("Order canceled - money refunded.");
        println!("We hope you to see in another service.\n");
        self.stay()
    }
}
```

Both methods above starts _from_ `Reserved`. `fn reserved()` is a green path and `fn cancel_order()` is a path that points itself(cause there's no state to go before this level).

Let continue with other states.

```rust:main.rs
...

impl FoodDelivery<Cooking> {
    fn cooking_finished(&self) -> FoodDelivery<Delivering> {
        println!("Your food is successfully cooked!");
        println!("Now we'll send your food via delivery guy.\n");
        self.proceed::<Delivering>()
    }

    fn cannot_cook(&self) -> FoodDelivery<Reserved> {
        println!("Cannot cook your food - ingredients are out of stock.");
        println!("We'll guide you to cancel your order and get refunded.\n");
        self.proceed::<Reserved>()
    }
}

impl FoodDelivery<Delivering> {
    fn delivered(&self) -> FoodDelivery<Arrived> {
        println!("Delivery guy finished delivering your food.\n");
        self.proceed::<Arrived>()
    }

    fn taking_food_back(&self) -> FoodDelivery<Cooking> {
        println!("We are taking your food back to the kitchen.");
        println!("We will tell chef to cook your food again.\n");
        self.proceed::<Cooking>()
    }
}

impl FoodDelivery<Arrived> {
    fn confirm_arrival(&self) -> Self {
        println!("Food has arrived! Have a nice meal :)\n");
        self.stay()
    }

    fn cancel_arrival(&self) -> FoodDelivery<Delivering> {
        println!("Oh no! Wrong food :(");
        println!("We will take your food again via delivery man/woman\n");
        self.proceed::<Delivering>()
    }
}
```

Same, the each methods starts _from_ each states. By now you'd notice some interesting parts.

- Transition methods are separated for each states: Even though we're implementing the same `FoodDelivery` struct,
  methods are implemented in separated manner for each `FoodDelivery<State>`.
- `self.proceed()` and `self.stay()`: For transition from state A to B, we can move forward(`proceed`), otherwises we need to `stay`.

The reason for the first one is because the underlying generic parameter is filled with different type.
And that makes our Rust compiler to consider `FoodDelivery<Reserved>` and `FoodDelivery<Delivering>` as completely different type in binary level.
For us, however, it feels like the type hasn't been changed but somehow Rust managed to separate the state transition methods - like magic!
This was possible because we used ZSTs - they are **real** types, doing a useful job like this even without any memory allocation.

One thing to consider - although transition methods are separated for each states, `self.proceed()` and `self.stay()` seems to be shared. How can this be?

### 3. Shared methods

```rust:main.rs
...

impl<State> FoodDelivery<State> {
    fn proceed<NextState>(&self) -> FoodDelivery<NextState> {
        FoodDelivery { state: PhantomData }
    }
    fn stay(&self) -> Self {
        Self { state: PhantomData }
    }
}
```

We can simply make methods sharable by implement methods not for the statically typed ones, but for the generics.
All we need to use is to implement with generic type parameter.

### 4. Test scenarios

Now let's test some scenarios! In this post I'll just repeat the two scenarios I described above(the _happy path_ and the _sad path_),
but you can build any state flows you can possibly create.

```rust:main.rs
...

fn main() {
    println!("\n{:=^50}\n", " Happy Path ");
    let happy_path = FoodDelivery::default()
        .reserved()
        .cooking_finished()
        .delivered()
        .confirm_arrival();

    println!("\n{:=^50}\n", " Turns out Sad Path ");
    let _turns_out_sad = happy_path
        .cancel_arrival()
        .taking_food_back()
        .cannot_cook()
        .cancel_order();
}
```

Splendid isn't it? Let's try out.

```bash:Terminal
$ cargo run

[Output]

=================== Happy Path ===================

Your delivery has been successfully placed!
Now we'll start cooking your food.

Your food is successfully cooked!
Now we'll send your food via delivery guy.

Delivery guy finished delivering your food.

Food has arrived! Have a nice meal :)


=============== Turns out Sad Path ===============

Oh no! Wrong food :(
We will take your food again via delivery man/woman

We are taking your food back to the kitchen.
We will tell chef to cook your food again.

Cannot cook your food - ingredients are out of stock.
We'll guide you to cancel your order and get refunded.

Order canceled - money refunded.
We hope you to see in another service.

```

We've built our own state machine with Rust's amazing type system. Hooray!

## Conclusion

In this post we've discovered about what is a _zero-sized type_ in Rust, and how should we use it.
One thing to clarify is that actually we've seen only **one of** the ZSTs.
There are others like `()`, `!` and much more, and yet we've seen the `struct` version of it.
Those also have an interesting usage to discuss about, but I am gonna leave them for future posts.

Thanks for reading my post! I'll see you later. Until then, **Happy Coding!**
