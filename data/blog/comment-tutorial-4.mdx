## Our final goal

This is the 4th and final part of the `Build comments section with Next.js and Supabase` series.
Make sure you've finished,

- [Part 1. Getting Started](https://hoonwee.com/blog/comment-tutorial-1/)
- [Part 2. Create/Read Comments](https://hoonwee.com/blog/comment-tutorial-2/)
- [Part 3. Update, Delete and Reply](https://hoonwee.com/blog/comment-tutorial-3/)

Finally we've reached the last part of this series! I am so proud of you guys who have been in this journey all along.

For our grand finale, we will gonna fix the data fetching part, which right now user needs to reload everytime they modify(create, edit, delete) the comments.
By using amazing library called [`SWR`](https://swr.vercel.app/), we will gonna fix this problem and it will take our comment section's user experience into whole another level.

The follow-along code can be found [here.](https://github.com/MRGRAVITY817/supabse-comments/tree/part-4)

## Implementing SWR

### A brief overview of SWR

There are numerous data-fetching libraries for Next.js, but one of the most popular and easiest to use is SWR.
Here's a simple example from their official document page(modified a little bit for better understanding).

```typescript
import useSWR from 'swr';

const fetcher = (url: string) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.body);

function Profile() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher);

  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>;
  if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>;
  return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>;
}
```

This simple looking code does something beautiful.

- It uses a hook called `useSWR`, which takes 2 arguments:
  - An `url` to fetch a data.
  - An `fetcher` function that'll fetch from the given url.
- Then you can just use the the `data`, like you use a React state.

See? It's so simple! Say goodbye to the hard days where you had to use several `useState`s and `useEffect`s to manipulate and update the
remote date - which is complicated easy to make mistakes.

As the name propose, the mechanism for this comes from a HTTP cache invalidation strategy called `stale-while-revalidate`.
Explaining the details about it is beyond our article, so better check out
[this link](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-strategies#stale-while-revalidate) if you're interested.

### Setting SWR, and refactor APIs

Now let's install SWR with the command below.

```bash:Terminal
$ yarn add swr
```

And we will replace our old method of fetching data to new one, using `useSWR`.

But first I am pretty sure our code need some refactoring, since we already have too much API-related code in our client-side file `index.tsx`.
Thankfully, Next.js provides us a `api` directory inside `pages` directory, which you can put all kinds of API codes.

Let's make new file `pages/api/comments.ts`, with the code down below.

```typescript:pages/api/comments.ts
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL + "";
const supabaseKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY + "";

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);

const CommentsApi = async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  switch (req.method) {
    // Get all comments
    case "GET":
      const { data: getData, error: getError } = await supabase.from("comments").select("*");
      if (getError) {
        return res.status(500).json({ message: getError.message });
      }
      return res.status(200).json(getData);
    // Add comment
    case "POST":
      const comment = req.body;
      const { data: postData, error: postError } = await supabase.from("comments").insert(comment);
      if (postError) {
        return res.status(500).json({ message: postError.message });
      }
      return res.status(200).json(postData);
    // Edit comment
    case "PATCH":
      const { commentId: editcommentId, payload } = req.body;
      const { data: patchData, error: patchError } = await supabase
        .from("comments")
        .update({ payload })
        .eq("id", editcommentId);
      if (patchError) {
        return res.status(500).json({ message: patchError.message });
      }
      return res.status(200).json(patchData);
    // Delete comment
    case "DELETE":
      const { comment_id: deleteCommentId } = req.query;
      if (typeof deleteCommentId === "string") {
        const { data: deleteData, error: deleteError } = await supabase
          .from("comments")
          .delete()
          .eq("id", deleteCommentId + "");
        if (deleteError) {
          return res.status(500).json({ message: deleteError.message });
        }
        return res.status(200).json(deleteData);
      }
    default:
      return res.status(405).json({
        message: "Method Not Allowed",
      });
  }
};

export default CommentsApi;
```

Now that's a lot of code all of a sudden! Don't worry, I'll explain one-by-one.

- `CommentsApi` function takes `req` which is a request from the caller of this API,
  and `res` which is a response that we'll modify according to the request.
- Inside the function, we encounter a `switch` condition filter with 5 `case`s:
  - `case "GET"`: This will be called for getting comments.
  - `case "POST"`: This will be called for adding a comment.
  - `case "PATCH"`: This will be called for editing a comment.
  - `case "DELETE"`: This will be called for deleting a comment.
  - `default`: This will omit error for unsupported methods.

So what we've done is just moving the API related stuffs to this file.
Each implementation inside the `case` block is identical to ones we've written in `index.tsx`.
It uses `await supabase.from("comments").something(...)` for every case.

Now we've made our decent looking API code, how do we access to it? It's super-easy - Just fetch "/api/comments".

### Replacing 'get comments'

Now we are going to use our well organized `comments.ts` API with `useSWR` hook.
First let's replace the old implementation of getting all the comments.

Edit & Delete codes in `index.tsx` with the code below.

```typescript:pages/index.tsx {4, 7, 35, 41, 50}

...

const fetcher = (url: string) => fetch(url, { method: "GET" }).then((res) => res.json());

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  const { data: commentList, error: commentListError } = useSWR<CommentParams[]>("/api/comments", fetcher);
  /* Deleted
	const [commentList, setCommentList] = useState<CommentParams[]>([]);
	*/
  const [comment, setComment] = useState<string>("");

...

	/* Deleted
	const getCommentList = async () => {
		const { data, error } = await supabase.from("comments").select("*");
		if (!error && data) {
			setCommentList(data);
		} else {
			setCommentList([]);
		}
	};

	useEffect(() => {
		getCommentList();
	}, []);
	*/

...

<div className="flex items-center justify-start gap-2">
	<ReplyIcon className="w-4 text-gray-600 rotate-180" />
	<p className="font-extralight italic text-gray-600 text-sm">
		{commentList?.find((comment) => comment.id === replyOf)?.payload ?? ""}
	</p>
</div>

...

	{(commentList ?? [])
		.sort((a, b) => {
			const aDate = new Date(a.created_at);

...

<div className="flex items-center justify-start gap-2">
	<ReplyIcon className="w-3 text-gray-600 rotate-180" />
	<p className="font-extralight italic text-gray-600 text-xs">
		{commentList?.find((c) => c.id === comment.reply_of)?.payload ?? ""}
	</p>
</div>

...

```

Here's what happened:

- Removed `commentList` React State, `getCommentList` function and `useEffect` which was used to update comments when data is refetched.
- Replaced that part with a single line of code(or maybe 2 or 3 lines of code depending on your formatter), using `useSWR` hook.
  - Same as an example from above, it contains `url("/api/comments")` and `fetcher`.
  - Since we are using `GET` method with `fetch`, our `GET` case in `comments.ts` is executed, which fetches the full comment list.
- Added little `?` and ` ?? []` to `commentList` when it's used for `find`ing or `sort`ing something.
  - A reason for this is because our data fetched from `useSWR` is fallible, so it counts for the chance to being a `undefined` for fetch failure.
  - So we should inform the `find` function with `?` typing that it might contain the `undefined` data.
  - For `sort` function, which doesn't tolerate `undefined`, we have to hand over at least the empty array.

We changed our code a lot, in a good way! Our comment section should work just the same.

### Replacing "add comments"

Next we'll replace 'add comment' feature. To do that we have to add another fetching function which will send a post request to our `comments.ts`.

Add `addCommentRequest` function right after `fetcher`.

```typescript:pages/index.tsx {6-11}

...

const fetcher = (url: string) => fetch(url, { method: "GET" }).then((res) => res.json());

const addCommentRequest = (url: string, data: any) =>
  fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  }).then((res) => res.json());

const Home: NextPage = () => {

...

```

We stringify the comment data and post it. No difficult things to be explained.

Now we'll use an interesting feature of SWR, called `mutate`.
Using `mutate` we can modify the local cache of comment list before we even refetch the updated list from Supabase server.

Let's discover the behaviour by just implementing it. Update the `onSubmit` function, and edit our add comment form.

```typescript:pages/index.tsx {4-20, 26}

...

  const onSubmit = async (event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const newComment = {
      username: "hoonwee@email.com",
      payload: comment,
      reply_of: replyOf,
    };
    if (typeof commentList !== "undefined") {
      mutate("api/comments", [...commentList, newComment], false);
      const response = await addCommentRequest("api/comments", newComment);
      if (response[0].created_at) {
        mutate("api/comments");
        window.alert("Hooray!");
        setComment("")
      }
    }
  };

...

	<input
		onChange={onChange}
		value={comment}
		type="text"
		placeholder="Add a comment"
		className="p-2 border-b focus:border-b-gray-700 w-full outline-none"
	/>

```

We removed our old `await supabase...` and replaced it with someting else:

- We added two `mutate` functions, which will refetch comment list that has added a new comment. But why two?
  - The first one won't actually refetch the data.
    Instead it will **assume** that adding a comment has succeeded, and **pretend** that it refetched it by modifying the local cache of comment list.
  - Now the second one will actually refetch the data, and compare between data modified and data refetched.
    When it's equal, it does nothing. While there's any difference, it will rerender for the correct comment list.
- There's a `await addCommentRequest` function call in between two `mutate` functions. This will send a POST request to `comments.ts` API, and return the response for the request.
  - Once succeeded adding a comment, it will return an array with single comment item.
  - So if the response is an array, and the first element has `created_at` field, the request is confirmed to be successful
    so we'll use second `mutate` function to compare with modified cache, and initalize the comment form with `setComment` by setting an empty string.

Now with our powerful cache-modifying code, we can see updated comment list **without reloading** the page!

### Replacing "edit, delete comments"

Let's practice using `mutate` one more time, replacing old code for editing comment.
Add & Replace code like down below.

```typescript:pages/index.tsx {4-9, 13-36}

...

const editCommentRequest = (url: string, data: any) =>
  fetch(url, {
    method: "PATCH",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  }).then((res) => res.json());

...

  const confirmEdit = async () => {
    const editData = {
      payload: editComment.payload,
      commentId: editComment.id,
    };
    if (typeof commentList !== "undefined") {
      mutate(
        "api/comments",
        commentList.map((comment) => {
          if (comment.id === editData.commentId) {
            return { ...comment, payload: editData.payload };
          }
        }),
        false
      );
      const response = await editCommentRequest("api/comments", editData);
      console.log(response);
      if (response[0].created_at) {
        mutate("api/comments");
        window.alert("Hooray!");
        setEditComment({ id: "", payload: "" });
      }
    }
  };

...

```

The flow is the same as we've done for `onSubmit` function.

- We first added a `editCommentRequest` fetcher function.
- We added two `mutate`, the _pretending_ one, and the _real one_ in `confirmEdit`.
- Before executing 2nd `mutate`, we check if our request has succeeded with `response[0].created_at`.
- Finally we reset the `editComment` state.

Let's do the same work for deleting comments.

```typescript:pages/index.tsx {4-5, 9-23}

...

const deleteCommentRequest = (url: string, id: string) =>
  fetch(`${url}?comment_id=${id}`, { method: "DELETE" }).then((res) => res.json());

...

  const confirmDelete = async (id: string) => {
    const ok = window.confirm("Delete comment?");
    if (ok && typeof commentList !== "undefined") {
      mutate(
        "api/comments",
        commentList.filter((comment) => comment.id !== id),
        false
      );
      const response = await deleteCommentRequest("api/comments", id);
      if (response[0].created_at) {
        mutate("api/comments");
        window.alert("Deleted Comment :)");
      }
    }
  };

...

```

No explaination needed! It's the same as we did for editing comment.

Try editing & deleting comment, and check if the comment list changes properly without reloading.

## And we are done!

Congratulations! We successfully built a comments section with feature of:

- CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete)ing the comments, with **Supabase** node library.
- Mutate UI without reloading with **SWR**
- Clean & understandable design, powered by **TailwindCSS** and **Hero Icons**.

Although our comment section is awesome, there are some improvements to be made (do it by yourself!):

- Replace browser's alert/confirm window to _toast UI_. It will look better.
- Implement _user login_, to make it usable in community service. You can make it from scratch, or...
  - Use Supabase's native user table
  - Use [Magic](https://magic.link/).
  - Use [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/).
- Transform the replying system into _threads_.

And that's all for this series! Thank you so much for following up this far, and I hope to see you on my next blog post/series!

Until then, happy coding!
