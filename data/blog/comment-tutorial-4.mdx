# Recap

This is the 4th and final part of the `Build comments section with Next.js and Supabase` series.
Make sure you've finished,

- [Part 1. Getting Started](https://hoonwee.com/blog/comment-tutorial-1/)
- [Part 2. Create/Read Comments](https://hoonwee.com/blog/comment-tutorial-2/)
- [Part 3. Update, Delete and Reply](https://hoonwee.com/blog/comment-tutorial-3/)

In the last post we created two features - creating and reading comments.

In this chapter we will update, delete and reply our comments. It won't be too different from the last time!
