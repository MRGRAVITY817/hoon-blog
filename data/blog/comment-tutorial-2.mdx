# Recap

_This is a 2nd part of the `Build comments section with Next.js, SWR and Supabase` series.
If you hadn't read the Part 1, checkout [here](https://hoonwee.com/blog/comment-tutorial-1)._

Last time we've created our Typescript based NextJS app and installed TailwindCSS for easy styling.
Then we headed to Supabase dashboard to create our own PostgreSQL comments table.

In this chapter we will create, read, update, and delete our comments with our comments form.

# Create comment

## Add input form and Supabase client library

Our index page is kinda empty now, so we should make it look better. Replace the code in `pages/index.tsx` to the code down below.

```tsx:pages/index.tsx
import type { NextPage } from "next";
import Head from "next/head";

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>Comments Page</title>
      </Head>
			<div className="pt-36 flex justify-center">
        <div className="min-w-[600px]">
          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold ">Comments</h1>
          <form onSubmit={onSubmit} className="mt-8 flex gap-8">
            <input type="text" placeholder="Add a comment" className="p-2 border-b focus:border-b-gray-700 w-full outline-none" />
            <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-green-500 rounded-lg text-white">Submit</button>
          </form>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

We added as simple input form to create a comment. There are some styling codes added,
but since this is not a TailwindCSS tutorial I will leave the explanation to better [resource](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first).

Our form looks good, but it doesn't really do anything. To create a comment, we should do this process:

1. User type the comment in the form, then hit `Submit`.
2. We somehow send the comment data to our Supabase `comments` table.
3. We check our table, see if the data has been added.

To perform the 2nd step, we need a Supabase node client library. Run the command below to add it.

```bash:Terminal
$ yarn add @supabase/supabase-js
```

## Make our messenger for Supabase

Now we need to create a supabase client object, which is a messenger that will help us interact with Supabase.
Add these 2 lines in `pages/index.tsx`.

```tsx:pages/index.tsx
...
// Added start
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);
// Added end

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
...
```

To create a Supabase client object, we need two data: Supabase project URL and key.
These can be found in `Settings > Project settings > API` section in our Supabase project dashboard.

  height={500}
/>

## Understanding environment variables

These keys should be stored somewhere secure and separate.
Many of the developers save secured data as _'environment variables'_, commonly shorten as 'env vars'.

Env vars also works as 'variables' which can be set differently across the environment.
For our case, we need to define env vars for development environment, and to do that in NextJS, we use `.env.local` file.
If you want to use the same variables in production environment, you can use `.env.production` file and replace the values.

Ok, now let's create a `.env.local` file in our NextJS app's root directory.
Then copy-paste the first key (anon/public key) in the image above and save it to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY`.
For the second key (URL key), save it to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`.

If done correctly, it should look like this.

```text:.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=[first-key]
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[second-key]
```

Now what's all that `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix? NextJS handles env vars differently by their names:

- With `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix: Those are exposed in browser, which means it can be used in client-side jobs.
- Without `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix: Those are server-side jobs.

So that means our supabase basically use those keys in browser side. Once we define or edit our `.env.local` file, we have to restart
the development server, so go to terminal and kill the current session with `CTRL-C`, and then restart with `yarn dev`.

Since we can use our env vars now, add and edit the following lines in `pages/index.tsx`.

```tsx:pages/index.tsx
...
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

// Added start
const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL ?? "";
const supabaseKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY ?? "";
// Added edited

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey); // Edited

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
...
```

The extra `?? ""` after each env var initalization is to prevent them to be `undefined` type, which then `createClient` won't accept it.

## Send an `insert` request

Before we use our `supabase` messenger, we will first get user's comment payload from our input form.
To do that,

1. Add a `comment` react state for the placeholder of user's comment payload.
2. Add `onChange` function to update the comment payload in `comment` whenever the payload is changed.
3. Add `onSubmit` function to handle the submit behavior of the form.
   In our case we don't want to reload everytime when we submit the form, so we use `event.preventDefault()`.

The code change will be as following.

```tsx:pages/index.tsx
...
const Home: NextPage = () => {
  // Added start
  const [comment, setComment] = useState<string>("");

  const onChange = (event: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const commentValue = event.target.value;
    setComment(commentValue);
  };

  const onSubmit = (event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    event.preventDefault();
		console.log(comment);
  };
  // Added end
...
		<form onSubmit={onSubmit} className="mt-8 flex gap-8"> {/* Edited */}
			<input
				onChange={onChange} {/* Edited */}
				type="text"
				placeholder="Add a comment"
				className="p-2 border-b focus:border-b-gray-700 w-full outline-none"
			/>
...
```

To test if it works, open the Devtools for your browser and head to `Console` tab, type something in the input and hit `Submit`.
If succeeded, it will show like the image below.

<Image
  alt={`Comments form test`}
  src={'/static/images/blog/comment-tutorial/comments-form-test.png'}
  comment={`Browser devtools are must-use utility for every web developers.`}
  height={400}
/>

Now we'll use our supabase client to create a comment. In SQL table's perspective, it will basically add a new row.
Replace `onSubmit` function to code down below. Don't forget to add an `async` keyword since the supabase client api returns a `Promise`.

```tsx:pages/index.tsx
...
  const onSubmit = async (event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const { data, error } = await supabase.from("comments").insert({
      username: "hoonwee@email.com",
      payload: comment,
    });

    if (!error && data) {
		// If succeed
      window.alert("Hooray!");
    } else {
		// If failed
      window.alert(error?.message);
    }
  };
...
```

Let me disect the `await supabase` part real quick:

- `.from("comments")` : This indicates which table should be looked for, since theoretically we have lot's of table in project.
- `.insert(table_row)` : By using `insert`, we create a new row in our `comments` table with give table_row data.

  - As you can see, we have only put `username` and `payload` in our `table_row`, because the rest of the data will have it's default value.

- `const { data, error }`: Supabase will give us a response containing `data` which contains information of our action, and `error` if there's an error.

Now let's write something again and hit `Submit`. And if you have succeeded, you'll see an alert window containing **Hooray!** message.

Well that's pretty nice, but we still don't know whether our data has been sent or not.
Head to `comments` table in Supabase dashboard, and you'll see a new data row inserted.

<Image
  alt={`Comment added`}
  src={'/static/images/blog/comment-tutorial/hooray.png'}
  comment={`Hooray! Comment added!`}
  height={300}
/>

# Read comments

## Create a comment list

Okay great, now we can create comments but we also want to display them in our web page.
To do that we'll do following steps:

1. We get all the comments from the `comments` table.
2. We display it - in list-like format.
3. We will sort then by `created_at` data to see them chronologically.

First we should add some UI for the list! Add the following code in `pages/index.tsx`.

```tsx:pages/index.tsx
...
export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);

// Added start
interface CommentParams {
  id: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  username: string;
  payload: string;
  reply_of?: string;
}
// Added end

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  // Added start
  const [comment, setComment] = useState<string>("");
  const [commentList, setCommentList] = useState<CommentParams[]>([]);
  // Added end
...
          Submit
        </button>
      </form>
      // Added start
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 pt-12">
        {commentList.map((comment) => (
          <div key={comment.id} className="border rounded-md p-4">
            <p className="font-semibold mb-2">{comment.username}</p>
            <p className="font-light">{comment.payload}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      // Added end
    </div>
...
```

Let's disect this part real quick:

1. Below our `form` element we added a comment list section, iterated by `commentList` react state that we newly created.
2. The `commentList` state has a array-type of `CommentParams` interface, which contains all the column names for each object key.
3. The question mark `?` at `reply_of` field indicates that this field is optional.

## Send a `select` request

Before moving to next step, I want you to add more comments using our form

- because once we succeed to get the comments from supabase, it will look awesome when we have bunch of comments.

Once you've done adding more comments, now let add a new function called `getCommentList` that will use `supabase` client to
get all the comments. Add the code down below.

```tsx:pages/index.tsx
...
  const [commentList, setCommentList] = useState<CommentParams[]>([]);

  // Added start
  const getCommentList = async () => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.from("comments").select("*");
    if (!error && data) {
      setCommentList(data);
    } else {
      setCommentList([]);
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    getCommentList();
  }, []);
  // Added end
...
```

Right now `getCommentList` function will be called **once** only, when we first render our page.
To do that we will call our `getCommentList` in `useEffect` hook. Since the `useEffect` hook has no external dependency,
this will invoke the inner part only once when the component is rendered.

Now check our web page. It will look much like other comment sections!

# Summary

Now to summarize what we've done so far:

- Created an input form for user to write comments
- Created a comment list section to see all the comments
- Used `insert` and `select` to create and read the table data.

In the next post we'll do `update` and `delete` part, so stay tuned!

Until then, Happy coding!
